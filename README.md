# Dog-Images-App

This is a simple app that does an API call to the Dog API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
) then transforms the received JSON data by striping out a dog image url and inserts it into a local Postgres DB.  This App utilizes a Dust.js frontend templating engine and Express as a backend web application framework.
